# Minimizing-waste-in-a-Woodworking-Company-by-Implementing-One-Dimensional-Cutting-Stock-Problem
Purpose: 
The main objective of this project is to develop a model for solving the one dimensional cutting stock problem in the woodworking industry, and develop a computer program for its implementation.
Design: 
This project adopts the pattern oriented approach in the formulation of the cutting stock model. A pattern generation algorithm was developed and coded using MATLAB language. The cutting stock model developed is a Linear Programming (LP) Model constrained by numerous feasible patterns. A LP solver was integrated with the pattern generation algorithm program to develop a one - dimensional cutting stock model application.
Findings: 
Applying the model to a real life optimization problem significantly reduces material waste (off-cuts) and minimizes the total stock used.
Research limitations: 
This study round up the linear programming solution for the number of pattern to cut. 

Practical implications: 
From Managerial perspective, implementing optimized cutting plans increases productivity by eliminating calculating errors and drastically reducing operator mistakes. Also, financial benefits that can annually amount to millions in cost savings can be achieved through significant material waste reduction.
